I'm Siddhartha Bitla, done my Master's from [VIT University](http://vit.ac.in) and keenly interested in Open Source projects and research in Machine Learning and Algorithms.

### More Information

I read a _lot_ of books, philosophy in particular. Love to explore new ideas, new technologies, open source projects, hangout with people who try to make a difference. I dream to own and learn _guitar_ in future. Definitly I play sport, travelling, painting, and what not..! So, by all the means I am just like a normal common guy. That's it for now_!!!_
